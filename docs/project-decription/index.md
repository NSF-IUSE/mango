# **Project Definition**

## **Objectives:**

1. Be able to conduct the software change process;

2. Be able to write software documents (requirement specification, design document, test cases);

3. Work in the team environment;

4. Practice presentation and communication skills requested by software engineering.

## **Team Setup:**

This course project is team based. Students attending this course will be grouped into 4 teams (5 students per team) and focus on software maintenance of an open-source software Mango. Teams will work on 5 new features of Mango, which are provided through feature description documents.  These 5 features are supposed to include 2 easy ones, 2 medium difficult ones and 1 hard one.

Each team needs tomust choose a member as the project leader (with 5% bonus of the final project points). The project leader has the responsibility of managing the project and coordinating tasks. Each feature will have a feature champion, who will lead this feature development. Among the 5 team members, one member will be the feature champion for the two easy features. Each medium difficult feature will have a single feature champion. The hard feature will have two feature campions including the project leader and one more team member.

All documents, presentation slides, source codes and other deliverables must be uploaded to the moodleMoodle before the due date. At the end of the semester, the team members will do a cross evaluation of contribution among each other.

Grading rules for each deliverable will be posted on moodleMoodle assignments. Late submission will not be accepted due to the presentation schedule.

## **Feature Change Requests:**

This course project is team based. Students attending this course will be grouped into 4 teams (5 students per team) and focus on software maintenance of a well-known open source software mangi. Teams will work on 4 new features of mangi, which are listed below.

## **Grading:**

### **- _61 points (projects)_**

> P01: Mango Architecture Document & Presentation: 5 points
>
> P02: New Features Analysis (a.k.a., Requirements): 9 points
>
> P03: Design (Concept Location & Impact Analysis): 9 points
>
> P04: Test Cases & Results: 9 points
>
> Code Inspection: 9 points
>
>  New Features: 20 points (10 points/feature, your grading = (your feature/# of your features) + (sum of others’ features/# of others’ features))

### **- _9 points – Labs (3 points per lab)_**
### **- _5 points - Cross Evaluation of Contribution of Team Members_**
### **- _5 points – Attendance (10 random checkpoints, and 0.5 point per checkpoint)_**
### **- _20 points – Exam_**

## **Criteria:**
- Grading rule for each assignment will be posted on moodle.

## **Deliverables & Schedule & Grading Rules:**

All documents, presentation slides, source codes and other deliverables must be uploaded to the moodle before the due date. Grading rules for each deliverable are shown below. Late submission will not be accepted unless the instructor has been notified with an acceptable reason (e.g., health issues, travel for academic conferences or interviews, …, on a case by case basis).

### **1 - _Mangi Architecture Diagrams (Due: February 8, 2022)_**

> (1). You can use any tool including Mangi itself to draw the UML diagrams extracted from Mangi source codes. The diagrams include one static diagram (similar to C++ class diagram, called pseudo class diagram) and one activity diagram (3 points for each of them: 3 - Good, 2 - Fair, 1 - Poor). Your diagrams need to have significant improvement compared to the sample ones. Otherwise, you cannot get the points.
>
> (2). One-page summary explaining these two diagrams and your improvements in details is requested. (2 point)
>
> (3). Presentation slides are not requested. You can present based on your diagrams and the summary. (2 points)
>
> Note that the rules for the absence of presentation are the same as before.

### **2 - _Requirement Book (Due: March 1, 2021)_**

> (1). Requirement Book for new features (6 points per feature, and the final grading is the average points of all features)
>
> (Very Poor: 1 point, Poor: 2 point, Fair: 3 points, Fair/Good: 4 points, Good: 5 points, Excellent: 6 points)
>
> Grading Criteria:
>
> Very Poor: No difference compared to the feature change requests.
>
> Poor: Difference can be observed, but requirements are not itemized.
>
> Fair: Difference can be observed, and requirements have been itemized.
>
> Fair/Good: All itemized requirements are feasible, testable, concise, and clear.
>
> Good: Sufficient interaction with other relevant features have been included.
>
> Excellent: Smart, effective and user friendly solutions have been proposed to address the feature interaction.
>
> (2). Presentation: 2 points (must attend the presentation to get this credit)
>
