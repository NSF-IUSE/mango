# **Course Grading**

## **Team Setup:**

This course project is team based. Students attending this course will be grouped into 4 teams (5 students per team) and focus on software maintenance of an open-source software Mango. Teams will work on 5 new features of Mango, which are provided through feature description documents.  These 5 features are supposed to include 2 easy ones, 2 medium difficult ones and 1 hard one.

Each team needs tomust choose a member as the project leader (with 5% bonus of the final project points). The project leader has the responsibility of managing the project and coordinating tasks. Each feature will have a feature champion, who will lead this feature development. Among the 5 team members, one member will be the feature champion for the two easy features. Each medium difficult feature will have a single feature champion. The hard feature will have two feature campions including the project leader and one more team member.

All documents, presentation slides, source codes and other deliverables must be uploaded to the moodleMoodle before the due date. At the end of the semester, the team members will do a cross evaluation of contribution among each other.

Grading rules for each deliverable will be posted on moodleMoodle assignments. Late submission will not be accepted due to the presentation schedule.
